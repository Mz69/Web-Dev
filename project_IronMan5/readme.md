	Our project is a simple website designed for online shopping of outdoorsy items. The website has two functionalities, 
	one for users and one for the website owner/administrator. The user can login or sign up and then browse through the products offered by the website, 
	add them to their online cart, check out their online cart and send messages to the admins. The admin can add products to the product list, 
	modify products and delete products. Furthermore, the admin can see emails send to them and emails they send, they can answer these emails, 
	send new emails, or delete the emails. 
	The website is designed in such a way that if a user does not have an account, 
	they can create one, without being logged in a user has severally reduced capabilities of the website, 
	the user can only look at products, see their details and access the contact form. Once logged in a user can also add items to their cart and go to checkout, 
	when logged in the billing information of the user is also automatically added to the checkout form.

	Addition Information:
		The three existing accounts are:
			rey@theforce.org (password: balance)
			yoda@theforce.org (password: yoda)
			admin@admin.org (password: admin)
